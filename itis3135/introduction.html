	Professional: First "legit" job for pay was stacking bricks in the New Mexico desert for $2/hr. Best paid job was $1000 for an hour-long presentation. Lots of stuff in between ranging from movie theater projectionist to intructional developer trainer. Been a community college teacher for since 2001.
	Academic background: BSLA, MS/MIS, lots of training - i mean lots. Worked in everything from Ski Instruction to Movie theaters, but more recently as a consultant and teacher. I do a lot of conference presentations and professional workshops, and teach in a couple of different places along with my full-time work at CPCC. Information/Technology background: Started with macs in early 90's, then on to PC's in grad school, and now just see 'em all as tools. I want them to do the job, and don't care about much else. I see computers as magnifications of possibilities.
	Background in the subject matter of this course: I've been using computers since I was in college, and eventually ended up working on a computer store (including selling the software we teach in this class!) and getting a Masters in Management Information Systems. That doubled my salary in one year!
	Primary Computer Platform: Windows 7-10 at home and work, though I just got a mac laptop to play with.
	Courses I'm teaching and reason for each:
	WEB210 - Web Design - we have to recreate this since the big hack of '21
	WEB115 - Web Markup and Scripting - one of my regulars. Mostly JS
	CIS110 - Introduction to Computers - we have a lot of these sections, so i teach it a lot.
	ITSC1212 - Introduction to Computer Science 1 (Java) - a core UNCC CS class I've taught twice before
	ITIS3135 - Web Design & Development - Teaching for the first time at Charlotte, but not new to subject
	Funny story or interesting item about yourself to remember you by: I donated my body to science in school to earn money - in one experiment i got $500 for letting them inject me with radioactive water for a PET scan. I'll always wonder...
	I'd also like to share: I'm hoping to make a vlogging channel that covers my adventures as a middle-aged dad.
