                <p>
                    This is the official zillow website where consumers can buy, sell and rent houses. 
                    This website follows the CRAP design principles:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Contrast:</strong> This website did an amazing job following this design principle. All the elements on the page are easy to read and stand apart from one another allowing for the veiwers eyes to flow naturally when looking at this webpage.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Repetition:</strong> This website does a great job when it comes to the design principle of repetition. They are consistent when it comes to the format of their webpage and following the same pattern throughout their entire site.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Alignment:</strong> Nothing on this website really feels out of place when you're looking at the design principle of alignment. All of the different sections are evenly lined up with each other and don't feel like they're somewhere they shouldn't be.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Proximity:</strong> This website does a great job at keeping the proximity of elements that are related to each other close to each other. It also does a good job at having each element or section evenly spaced out and feeling like they belong where they are.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </section>

                <a href = "https://www.art.yale.edu/"><h3>Yale School of Art</h3></a>
                <p>
                    This is the official website for the Yale School of Art. This website is made for the students who attend this school so they can recieve daily school news or general school information. 
                    This website does not follow the CRAP design principles:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Contrast:</strong> This website did not follow the design principle of contrast being that all of the elements on this page are difficult to read. Not only is it difficult to read it's not natural to the human eye at all making it extremely difficult to look at as a viewer.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Repetition:</strong> This website does follow a consistent design pattern. Although they follow the pattern consistently it's an unpleasant pattern and is not appealing in anyway.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Alignment:</strong> This webpage's alignment is completely off in comparison to the rest of the page. Everything is awkwardly pushed over the left slightly rather than being centered in the middle of the page.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Proximity:</strong> The proximity of related elements on this webpage are also off. Some of the elements are out of place and should be in proximity to a different element than it was.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
