//I honestly spent almost 2 hours just setting up the display of the calculator
//and that's still not even fully correct. All my experience in HTML and JavaScript
//has been in this class so far and althrough I have a good understanding I still
//struggle here and there especially with JavaScript being that I just started
//learning that language. I attempted the JavaScript on my own and didn't get anywhere at all
//I am going to follow the tutorial and type everything in myself and take my time to make sure 
//I really understand every line of code. Thank you for providing the tutorial for people who are 
//still really new like myself.
